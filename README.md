# Xelas not so convenient mysql UI

This piece of software was created with the intent to loewer the bundle size of the classic mysql interfaces and also have something thats portable and usabel at anytime in windows
im aware stuff like phpmyadmin exists but i offer soemthing thats not browser limited at times
some features include

## auto JSON generation (generates default values) and easily editable with any text editor
## a grid to show you the query results that can be resized ordered and whetever ud like
## i tested it on a database with 4~ million rows and the query times were around 3 seconds and populaation 9 (aka linking datasources for the grid)
